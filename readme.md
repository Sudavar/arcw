This is a modified version of Archives Calendar Widget for WordPress located here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/archives-calendar-widget/
I will try to patch any updated done to the original plugin and will concentrate on providing additional features.

Extra Features:
------------
- [x] Popover jQuery plugin integrated in order to show the titles of a day's posts rather than leading right into the archives.
- [x] Except from title, an image related to the post is shown. It's either the featured image or the first image in post.
- [ ] Option to displayed on a date selected from a meta data field.

Special thanks to Aleksei Polechin for his original plugin (You can find him here: http://alek.be/)
